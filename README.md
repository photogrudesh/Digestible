# Digestible

Digestible is a post-production workflow management system for part-time and freelance photographers.

Welcome! Digestible has three modes: Ingest, Digest, and Delegate. Each mode is designed to streamline your photography workflow, so you can spend less time sorting through images and more time doing what you love.

When you get home after a shoot, Ingest mode makes it easy to process the files from your camera. Digestible automatically sorts images by camera body, lens used, and orientation of the image so you don't have to.

After you've ingested your images, it's time to start culling! Digest mode helps you quickly identify images that are worth keeping by automatically separating images based on how usable they are. Digestible determines usability by analysing exposure and blurriness.

Once you've sorted your images, it's time to delegate them to your team for post-production. Delegate mode automatically splits the sorted images between editors evenly so editing can begin as soon as possible.
